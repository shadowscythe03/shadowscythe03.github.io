I am an M.Tech AI candidate at IIT Gandhinagar focused on generative models, multimodal learning, and robust in-context learning. I build end-to-end AI systems that connect research ideas to usable tools, from story-to-video generation pipelines to multimodal physiological signal fusion for healthcare. I am currently interning at GlobalFoundries (GenAI) in Bangalore. My current research explores multi-armed bandit methods for exemplar selection in in-context learning under non-i.i.d. conditions.
