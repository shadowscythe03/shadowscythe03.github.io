        I am passionate about advancing AI through research in Generative Models, Multimodal Learning, and Robust In-Context Learning. My work spans building end-to-end pipelines for creative AI applications, developing multimodal fusion architectures for healthcare, and exploring bandit algorithms for improved LLM performance.

        Current research focuses on robust in-context learning with multi-armed bandit partitioning, achieving 85-95% recovery of baseline accuracy under non-i.i.d. conditions across diverse NLP benchmarks.

        Open to collaborations in Generative AI, Multimodal ML, and LLM research! 🚀
